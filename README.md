# MFD Receiver demo #

This android app demonstrates how to receive real time data for MFD (multi functional display) from [Sygic Professional navigation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.fleet).

Data contains:

- current route information (ETA, next instructions, distance to next instructions, ...)
- real time vehicle information (speed, current street, ...)
- map information (lanes info, speed limit, ...)
- etc.

Data can be used for visualization in multi-functional displays, head up displays, etc.
